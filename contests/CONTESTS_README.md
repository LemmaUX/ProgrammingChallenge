# Contests Organization

Directory for tracking contest participations and analysis.

## Contest Resources

This directory organizes problems and solutions from:

- **LeetCode Contests**: Weekly/Biweekly contests
- **Codeforces Rounds**: Div2/Div3/Div4 contests  
- **ICPC Training**: Team contest preparation

## Structure

## Contest Recording

For each contest, capture:

1. **Problems attempted** (solved / TLE / WA / skipped)
2. **Time spent** per problem
3. **Key insights** that helped solve
4. **Mistakes made** and fixes
5. **Better approaches** seen in editorial

## Performance Tracking

Track metrics to monitor improvement:

- **Contest rating** (Codeforces, AtCoder)
- **Solve count** per difficulty
- **First-attempt success** percentage
- **Weak categories** (to practice more)

## Contest Strategy

### Pre-Contest
- [ ] Solve 2-3 similar problems
- [ ] Review common pitfalls in category
- [ ] Prepare template files
- [ ] Warm up with 1-2 quick problems

### During Contest
- [ ] Read all problems (5 min)
- [ ] Rank by confidence (10 min)
- [ ] Solve easiest first (high confidence)
- [ ] Flag and come back to harder
- [ ] Last 5 min: review code, check output format

### Post-Contest
- [ ] Wait for editorial
- [ ] Solve problems you missed
- [ ] Understand better approaches
- [ ] Record learnings
- [ ] Adjust practice based on weaknesses
