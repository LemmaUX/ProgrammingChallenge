# Programming Challenge Repository

A professional, production-grade algorithm mastery lab for daily competitive programming training and FAANG/quant interview preparation.

## Purpose

- Serve as a long-term algorithm mastery environment
- Support daily problem solving, theory notes, reusable templates, and research logs
- Provide a scalable structure for 1000+ problems

## Repository Structure

Top-level directories:

- problems: Platform -> difficulty -> topic -> problem
- templates: Reusable competitive programming implementations
- theory: Structured theory notes and foundations
- research: Patterns, mistakes, optimization, interview strategies
- contests: Contest tracking and post-contest analysis
- utils: Shared helpers and utilities

## Daily Workflow

1. Review relevant theory and templates
2. Solve 1-3 problems with full documentation
3. Record insights, mistakes, and optimization ideas
4. Update research notes and revisit weak topics

## How Problems Are Documented

Each problem folder contains:

- problem.md: Statement, constraints, examples, observations
- solution.py: Initial correct solution
- solution_optimized.py: Optimized solution if applicable
- notes.md: Key insights, edge cases, and complexity

## Long-Term Mastery Goal

Build algorithmic intuition and implementation speed that enables:

- Confident solving of hard problems under time pressure
- Strong interview performance at top-tier companies
- Consistent success in competitive programming contests
