## Flexibility & Personalization

This roadmap is a **guide, not dogma**:

- If specific topics seem irrelevant to your goals, adjust focusing
- If certain topics require more depth, extend phase duration
- Participation in actual contests can accelerate learning
- Interview preparation may shift focus toward certain topic areas

The progression follows an empirical pattern of building from simple to complex, and from specific to general. However, individual learning curves vary.
